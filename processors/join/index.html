<p>It should be placed after a merge point in a parallel Juttle expression,
like this:</p>
<pre><code>(
  stream-1;
  stream-2;
)
| join [options]
| ... // process joined stream
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>read source1
             \
               join | reduce ...
             /
read source2
</code></pre>

<p>In its simplest form, join aligns its input streams by time stamp and
produces new output points by unioning the fields of successive matching
input points.</p>
<p>To join only points with matching field values, use <code>join fieldNameN</code> where fieldNameN serves as a foreign key in SQL join terms.</p>
<p>By default, an inner join is performed; use <code>-outer</code> option to do an outer join instead. Left or right outer join is achieved by specifying the input number of the "base" stream.</p>
<p>The <code>-nearest</code> option causes a streaming many-to-one join, while <code>-zip</code> option causes a streaming one-to-one join.</p>
<p>The time intervals between points are ignored by default when joining streams; set <code>:duration:</code> parameter in <code>-nearest</code> or <code>-zip</code> to join only points that are close in time.</p>
<p>For a non-streaming join that runs over the entire set of inputs, use <code>-once</code> option.</p>
<p>For a join that treats one or more inputs as a lookup table with timeless points, akin to a SQL relational join, use <code>-table</code> option.</p>
<p>Join can be used on a single stream, see <a href="#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<h5 id="notes">Notes</h5>
<h6 id="single-stream-join">Single Stream Join</h6>
<p>If used on a single stream, its points are grouped by their time stamp
or batch, and all points in a group are unioned to create an output
point. If optional joinFields are specified for the single stream, they
act like group-by fields, and there is an output point for each distinct
value of the joinFields among the points.</p>
<h6 id="multiple-stream-join">Multiple Stream Join</h6>
<p>Options to <code>join</code> can cause it to
operate like an SQL relational join across multiple input streams, where
batches of points on an input are analogous to SQL tables, and
individual points are analogous to rows in those tables. An optional
list of fieldNames specifies relational join keys between the input
batches. When points with matching key values appear on each input, new
points are produced containing the union of these matching points'
fields.</p>
<h6 id="batched-vs-unbatched-join">Batched vs Unbatched Join</h6>
<p>Streaming joins are computed continually as points or batches of points
arrive at the inputs. When a stream is batched, all points in a batch
are treated as a group for joining (as if they all had the batch's
ending time stamp). For an unbatched stream, all points having the same
time stamp are treated as a batch. It is okay to join a batched stream
with an unbatched stream.</p>
<h6 id="time-matching-in-many-to-one-and-one-to-one-join">Time Matching in Many-to-One and One-to-One Join</h6>
<p>To require exact time stamp matching for batches to be joined, specify
time as a join key along with any other join keys. If time is not listed
as a join key, inexact time matches are allowed. Equivalent time stamps
will always be joined when they are present. A streaming one-to-one join
without exact time stamp matching is specified with -zip true or -zip
:duration:. A streaming many-to-one join with -nearest :duration: (or
simply as join with no options). A one-to-one join matches each
successive input batch with one on its other inputs, matching by nearest
time stamp, and drops any extra input batches that do not have matches.
A many-to-one join performs a similar matching, but will re-use an input
batch if it remains the best match. </p>
<p>Both <code>-zip</code> and <code>-nearest</code> accept a duration limiting the
difference in time stamps allowed between matched batches, with :0:
behaving as if time had been specified as a join key. When time stamps
do not match exactly, an output point will be given the maximum time
stamp of its input points. A join without <code>-zip</code> or <code>-nearest</code> or time as a join key is
implicitly a <code>-nearest</code> join with no limiting duration.</p>
<h6 id="join-with-table-input">Join with Table Input</h6>
<p>A streaming join can treat some of its input batches as passive tables
with no associated time stamp. For example, this is useful for joining a
stream of event points having user IDs against a table of user names,
annotating the event point with its particular user name. 
The <code>-table</code> option lists which inputs are to be
treated in this way. The "table" input can be timeless (i.e. its data points do not contain a <code>time</code> field at all), or if it has timestamps, they will be ignored when joining.</p>
<p>A batch on a table input remains there until
updated by a later batch, and joins are always performed against the
most recently received complete batch. Joins are only triggered by the
arrival of new points on a timeful input. Because tables are timeless, a
join is never triggered by an update to a table, and no guarantees can
be made about precisely when (in stream time) an update will displace a
current table batch.</p>
<h6 id="non-streaming-join">Non-streaming Join</h6>
<p>A non-streaming join over all points at once (at the end of the run) can
be specified by the <code>-once</code> flag. 
The join is not computed until all points have arrived at the inputs (that
is, it only makes sense for historic queries or bounded live queries).
Time stamps will be ignored unless the time field is specified as a join
field, which forces time stamps to be matched exactly between the input
sets.</p>
<p>Note: -nearest, -zip, and -once are mutually exclusive. If none are specified, the behavior is as if -nearest was specified with an unbounded duration.</p>
<h5 id="join-examples">Join Examples</h5>
<p><em>Example: merging metric points</em></p>
<p>One use for join is with a source that provides several different
metrics as name/value pairs on separate points having identical time
stamps. Use join to merge these onto a single point for each time stamp:</p>
<pre><code>emit -points [
  {time:&quot;2015-11-26T11:22:33.000Z&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;furlongs&quot;, value:25},
  {time:&quot;2015-11-26T11:22:33.000Z&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;fortnights&quot;, value:7},
  {time:&quot;2015-11-27T10:20:50.000Z&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;furlongs&quot;, value:34},
  {time:&quot;2015-11-27T10:20:50.000Z&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;fortnights&quot;, value:5}
]
  | put *name = value      // turn {name:&quot;furlongs&quot;, value:20} into {furlongs:20}
  | remove name, value       // those fields are no longer needed
  | join                   // combine points that have the same time value
  | put speed = furlongs/fortnights
</code></pre>

<p><em>Example: streaming one-to-one relational join</em></p>
<p>In this example, two input streams containing distance and time
measurements are joined so that a rate can be computed:</p>
<pre><code>// Join 1-1
//
// This demonstrates a synchronized join between two metric
// streams, allowing us to &quot;divide&quot; one stream by another
// to create a new metric. It does this by creating new points
// containing one metric from each input stream.
//
// one-to-one joining is triggered by 'join -zip &lt;duration&gt;'.
// an input point is matched to the point on the other
// input that is nearest (within &lt;duration&gt;) without being in the future.
// If we had specified &lt;duration&gt; of :0s:, timestamps would need to be equal.
// We instead specified -zip true, so any offset is allowed (but exact
// matches will always be made when they are present)

( emit 
  | put furlongs = Math.random()

| put speed = furlongs / fortnights

<p>The output is the result of the join: points containing a new metric:
"speed".</p>
<p><em>Example: streaming many-to-one relational join</em></p>
<p>In this example, two emits create two input streams for the join:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stream of "parts" that include a board-ID</li>
<li>A "table" of board-id -&gt; board name mappings. The example strips
   their time stamps away so that they are treated as a group (similar
   results occur if they all have the same time stamp)</li>
</ul>
<p>Joining the stream of parts against the table of board IDs creates
output points containing both the part name and its board name.</p>
<pre><code>// 9 parts having board_ids are joined against table of board_id-&gt;boardname
( emit -hz 1000 -limit 9
  | put part = &quot;part-&quot;+Number.toString(count()), board_id = count()%3 + 1, t = time-:now:  
  ; 
  emit -from :0: -hz 1000 -limit 3 
| put board = &quot;board-&quot; + Number.toString(count()), board_id = count() 
| remove time
) | join board_id 
| batch 100 
| keep t, part, board 
| view table
</code></pre>

<p>The input to the join is two tables: 3 rows of board_id-&gt;board
names, and 9 rows of parts (table commands are not included in the
Juttle above).</p>
<p>The output is the result of the join: points containing part names and
board names.</p>
<p><em>Example: streaming four-way right outer join</em></p>
<p>In this example, a stream of IDs (on points replayed by emit -points) is
simultaneously outer joined against three tables of personal
information.</p>
<p>Joining the stream of parts against the table of board IDs creates
output points containing both the part name and its board name.</p>
<pre><code>// 4-way right outer join of a point stream of ids against  tables of personal information.
//
// The points in the &quot;tables&quot; all have the same timestamp.
// For the join, the ID in each emit point
// is matched against each table, and an output point is created that is the union of all 
// matching points. This demonstrates partial joins when not all tables have an entry for 
// an ID. There are no matches at all for ID 5, so that point is passed through unchanged.
