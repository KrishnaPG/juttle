write
=====

Write sink uses [adapters supported by Juttle](../adapters/index.md) to send data points generated by the preceding Juttle flowgraph to the remote backend, usually for permanent storage. The newly written points can then be queried from the backend via `read <adapter>` just like any other points in Juttle.

```
... | write <adapter> adapter-options
```

Parameter  |  Description  |  Required?
---------- | ------------- | ---------:
`adapter`  | Name of the adapter to connect to the backend.  | Yes
`adapter-options`  | Options specific to writing to the chosen backend, handled by the adapter.  |  See adapter documentation

:warning: As adapters don't support operations that delete data, care must be
taken when setting up a program ending in write. We recommend always testing
your Juttle program by ending it in [view table](../sinks/view_table.md) or
[view text](../sinks/view_text.md) to see what data points it is
generating, and replacing those outputs with `write` only when you are fully
satisfied with the result.

_Example: Write random values into the InfluxDB database_

```
emit
| put value = Math.random()
| write influxdb
  -db "testdb"
  -measurement "mymetric"
```
