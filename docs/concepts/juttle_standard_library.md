Juttle standard library 
=======================

:construction: The Juttle standard library is under development.

Jut provides some useful modules in a [standard library](http://github.com/juttle/juttle/tree/master/lib/stdlib). Explore the
library to find modules you can use to enhance your Juttle programs.


Each program in the standard library contains multiple modules that you can [import](./programming_constructs.md#modules) into your own programs. The developers at Jut have provided comments inside
each program to explain each module's purpose and usage.

We're adding new modules all the time, so check the standard library for
the latest additions.
